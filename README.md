# linux-scripts
A compilation of scripts I want made easily accessible from few computers in a few locations.
```
linux-scripts
```
This is just a compilation of scripts for myself, helps with building on linux boxes and saves me a shitload of time
when fooling around with source, if you see something you like... Snatch 'n' run!

Peace! (iMnX)
